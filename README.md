# DBMS Project Github

An educational Database management system writen in C++ with the goal to teach new comers to database systems and it's implementation. The project is built in a step by step guide to make it intuitive as much as possible for beginners. C++ was chosen because it provides the required balance between complexity, preformance and features. There is nothing unique about this DBMS, its not the next Mysql. It's just a fun and educational project.

More detailed documentation will be provided in the future...
